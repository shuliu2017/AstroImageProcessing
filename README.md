# AstroImageProcessing
AstroImageProcessing is a Python package designed for astronomical image processing. It provides a toolkit for transforming and visualizing 2D arrays.

## Tutorials
- [MapReduce Algorithm](https://github.com/shuliu2017/AstroImageProcessing/blob/main/notebooks/MapReduce.ipynb): Crop an image into $n \times m$ pieces, process each piece independently and combine all processed pieces to a reconstructed image.

- [Simple Imaging_Polynomials (SIP)](https://github.com/shuliu2017/AstroImageProcessing/blob/main/notebooks/simple_imaging_polynomials.ipynb): Use polynomial expansion to represent geometric distortion of a linear coordiante transformation.
